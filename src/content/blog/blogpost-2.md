## Sweet dreams, my Annabel Lee

I thought what was mine was thine.  
And thine was my heart-  
that now drags itself,  
dust- stained, aching,  
and blind.

If thou didst not desire it,  
why take it?  
Why cast it here, forsaken?

Smaller, and smaller,  
ever smaller,  
while it crawls, still,  
after thee.
