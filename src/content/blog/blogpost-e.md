## Free and forced

How can you tell when someone is suffering because they’re trying to adapt to words you said unconsciously?

The pain and effort of someone who believes you would prefer them to change, to reshape their personality, is immense; especially when that was never what you intended. There’s no complaint from their side, not even a question.

What can a person do to stop carrying that weight once they finally, even years later, become aware of what happened?

Someone who tried to twist their own personality (which was already perfectly perfect to begin with) only to later hold it against you?
How do you carry that guilt? How do you avoid it? What could you have done differently, if you didn’t know at all?

And how can the other person let go of the resentment, after having used your words to mutilate their sense of self? As if before you, they were nothing. When if that were true, you never would have chosen them in the first place.

But time passes, perspectives shift, and suddenly you realize you’ve unknowingly reinforced that pain without ever meaning to
