The Tell-Tale Heart — Reimagined Version
True—yes, true! I’ve always been nervous, terribly, unbearably nervous. But why—why must you say I am mad? The illness did not dull my senses—oh no—it sharpened them, made them cruelly alive. Above all, my hearing—so sharp I could catch the faintest murmur from heaven, the smallest groan from hell. How, then—how can you call me mad? Listen. Watch how calmly, how perfectly sane I can tell you this story.
I cannot say when the thought first took root in my mind; but once it was there, it clung to me—day and night, like a shadow that breathes. There was no cause, no anger. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me, never mocked me. His money meant nothing to me. It was his eye—yes! that cursed eye! One of his eyes was like that of a vulture—a pale, cloudy blue, veiled by a ghastly film. Whenever it turned toward me, my blood froze. And so, little by little, very carefully, I resolved to rid myself of the old man—and of that eye—forever.
Now, you will say I am mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me—you should have seen how wisely I planned, how cautiously, how cunningly I moved! I was never kinder to the old man than during the week before I killed him. Every midnight I would turn the latch of his door, oh—so gently—and open it, inch by inch. When the crack was wide enough for my head, I slipped in my lantern—dark, completely shut—and then pushed in my head. You would have laughed to see me—how slyly, how slowly I crept in! It took me a full hour just to get my whole head through the opening far enough to see him lying on his bed. Ha! Would a madman have been so wise as that?
Then, when my head was fully in the room, I opened the lantern—just a little—so carefully, for the hinges creaked, opened it only enough to let one single thin ray fall upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights—every night at midnight—but the eye was always closed. And so I could not do the work; for it was not the man who tormented me, but his Evil Eye. Each morning, when the day broke, I went boldly to his room and greeted him cheerfully, calling him by name, asking how he had slept. He would never have guessed that each night, just as the clock struck twelve, I had looked upon him as he slept.
On the eighth night, I was even more cautious than before. My hand moved slower than the minute hand of a clock. Never before had I felt the power of my own cunning—my own triumph. Oh, how wisely, how cleverly I went to work! As I pushed the door open, inch by inch, he did not dream of my dark intentions. I smiled at the thought—perhaps he heard me, for he moved suddenly on the bed, startled. Now you may think I drew back—but no. His room was black as pitch—he had shut the shutters tight for fear of robbers—so I knew he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing on, slowly, steadily.
I had my head inside, and was just about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped on the metal clasp—and the old man sprang up in his bed, crying out:
“Who’s there?”
I froze. I said nothing. For a full hour I did not move a muscle, and in all that time I heard nothing. He sat there, listening—just as I had done night after night—straining his ear to the darkness, to the faint ticking of death beetles in the wall.
Then I heard it—a faint groan. It was not of pain or sorrow, no—it was the low, stifled sound that rises from the depths of the soul when terror grips it completely. I knew that sound well. Many a midnight, when all the world slept, it had burst from my own chest, echoing its dreadful music through the night. I knew it. I pitied him, though a twisted smile crawled across my lips. He had been awake since the first faint noise, the first small movement. He had been trying to convince himself: It’s just the wind in the chimney... just a mouse crossing the floor... only a cricket, nothing more. Yes—he tried to comfort himself, but it was useless. All in vain. Because Death, hidden in my shape, had crept toward him—slowly, silently—and its shadow had already touched his spirit. Though he could neither see nor hear it, he felt my presence in the room.
I waited. Oh, how long I waited—motionless, patient beyond all reason. At last, when I heard no breath of sleep, I resolved to open the lantern—a slit, the smallest slit imaginable.
I did it—oh, with what care—with what agony of caution! Until a thin ray, like the strand of a spider’s silk, shot from the crack and fell upon the cursed eye.
It was open—wide, wide open—and I saw it. A pale blue, veiled in that dreadful film that chilled the marrow in my bones. I saw nothing of the old man’s face or body, for I had trained the light—instinctively—on the eye, the hateful thing itself.
Have I not told you that what you call madness is only sharpened sense? Then, from deep within the silence, there came a sound—a dull, quick thumping, like a watch muffled in cotton. I knew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man’s heart. It grew stronger—faster—feeding the fire in my chest. The sound drove me mad, as a drum drives soldiers into battle.
Still I stood silent, scarcely breathing, keeping the lantern fixed upon the eye. The infernal beating grew louder—louder—LOUDER! The old man’s fear must have been terrible. Louder! Louder still! Do you hear? I told you I am nervous—yes, I am! And now, in that dreadful midnight stillness, the sound swelled until my own terror became unbearable. Yet still I waited—still I held the light steady. But it grew—it grew—LOUDER, ever LOUDER! I thought the heart would burst. And then a new fear struck me—the sound would be heard by a neighbor! The old man’s hour had come!
With a wild cry I flung open the lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once—only once. In an instant I dragged him to the floor and pressed the heavy mattress over him. I smiled then—yes, I smiled—for the deed was done. But for many minutes the heart still beat on, muffled beneath the weight. No matter. Through the walls, none could hear. At last, it stopped. The old man was dead—stone dead. I lifted the mattress and touched his heart—still, silent, at peace. Stone dead. That eye would trouble me no more.
